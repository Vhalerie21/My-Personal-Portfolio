  <h3> Ramon Magsaysay Highschool Chorale | 2021 - 2023</h3>
  <p> This was my <span style="font-weight: bold"> only organization throughout my junior highschool journey</span>,
     where I took the chance to audition despite being really afraid of performing infront of other people. Here I met so many new people, and learned how to be a better member in a group.
    I also took on a leadership role at my time at the choir, which was <span style="font-weight: bold">section leader</span> where I led the practice with my fellow sopranos.</p>
