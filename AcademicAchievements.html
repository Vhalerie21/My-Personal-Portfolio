    <h3 class="h3ach" style="font-size: 30px; color:#F3D9E5; text-shadow: none;">Senior Highschool Academic Achievements</h3>
    <p>Entering senior high school, I surpassed my own expectations and got a <span style="font-weight: bold;">consistent achievement of
       having high honors</span> despite being in multiple organizations. I was able to manage my time properly through <span style="font-weight: bold;">discipline and perseverance</span>, 
       whether it was for academics or extracurriculars. And I was even able to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">consistently ranked in my class within the top 3</span>. 
       Despite the endless workload of being a student leader in class and in organizations as well as my duties as a student.</p>

    <h3 class="h3ach" style="font-size: 30px; color:#F3D9E5; text-shadow: none;">Junior Highschool Academic Achievements</h3>
    <p>During my time at junior high school, this was where I decided to stay out of my comfort zone by joining extracurricular activities, one being the Ramon Magsaysay High School Chorale.
      I had my academic journey here, which was predominantly held online because of the pandemic. It was hard to adjust at first since the concept of online classes was still new.
      Despite that, I was able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">finish each grade being on the honor roll</span>. Here I learned how to keep going despite being faced with hard circumstances and learned that being in the spotlight isn't all that bad.</p>
